## me, but online

my next iteration of my personal website! 🖼️👩‍💻🌷 <br/> <br> I have always been amazed by impressionism, seeing how the paintings are more of an experience rather than simply a visual depiction. I wanted to translate that definition into my website and passion for tech, specifically how user experience design in the frontend is so important

next steps: <br/>
✷ more animations! <br/>
✷ responsive design for mobile and tablets
